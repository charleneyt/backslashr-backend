# you need three clean terminals, A, B, C
# in terminal A under the backslashr-backend/ run ./abc
# this will kill existing server and kvs and delete files, see above
# then start server and worker

# now kick off crawler in terminal C

# now you want to restart everything, because C is done or have errors
# in terminal B under the backslashr-backend/ run ./abc
# this will kill whatever in terminal A and start things in terminal B

# now terminal A becomes B
